Unit tests and integration tests are both essential components of software testing that serve different purposes and target different aspects of the codebase.

Unit Tests:

Unit tests focus on testing individual units or components of the code in isolation.
They are typically written and executed by developers during the development phase.
The primary goal of unit testing is to ensure that each unit of code (e.g., functions, methods, or classes) behaves as expected and produces correct results when tested in isolation.
Unit tests often use mock objects or stubs to isolate the unit being tested from its dependencies, such as databases or external services.
Unit tests are fast to execute and provide quick feedback during the development process.
They help catch and fix bugs early, promote code modularity, and make refactoring easier.
Popular testing frameworks for unit tests include JUnit (Java), pytest (Python), and NUnit (.NET).
Integration Tests:

Integration tests focus on testing the interaction between multiple components or modules of the application as a whole.
They validate the integration and communication between different units, ensuring that they work correctly when combined.
Integration tests often involve testing the application with real dependencies, such as databases, APIs, or external services, to simulate real-world scenarios.
The primary goal of integration testing is to identify issues that might arise when multiple components interact with each other, such as data mismatches, communication failures, or incorrect behavior due to integration complexities.
Integration tests are slower and may require additional setup and teardown of test environments or databases.
They help ensure that the system's components work together harmoniously and that the application as a whole meets the desired requirements and functionalities.
Popular testing frameworks for integration tests include TestNG (Java), Behave (Python), and NUnit (.NET).
