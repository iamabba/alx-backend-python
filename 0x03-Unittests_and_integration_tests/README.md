0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

Unit Tests:

Unit tests are a type of testing focused on verifying the correctness of individual units or components of a software application in isolation.
The term "unit" refers to the smallest testable part of an application, such as a function, method, or class.
In unit testing, each unit is tested independently to check if it behaves as expected and produces the correct output for a given set of inputs.
Unit tests are typically written and executed by developers during the development process to validate the functionality of code snippets or small portions of the application.
These tests are fast, specific, and easy to maintain since they target small and isolated pieces of code.
Mocks and stubs are often used to isolate units from their dependencies during unit testing, ensuring that the tests remain independent and reliable.
Integration Tests:

Integration tests are a type of testing that focuses on verifying the interactions and data flow between multiple units or components of an application when they are integrated together.
Integration tests ensure that the different parts of the system work cohesively and that data is correctly passed between them.
Unlike unit tests, integration tests involve testing multiple units or modules together, simulating real-world scenarios where units interact with each other.
Integration tests help detect issues that may arise when combining components, such as communication problems, data mismatches, or configuration errors.
These tests are broader in scope compared to unit tests and provide a more holistic view of the system's behavior and functionality.
Integration tests may be slower and require more setup compared to unit tests, as they involve larger portions of the application.
